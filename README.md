# FileStorage
This program receives exchange rates from the https://openexchangerates.org 
website and enters euro and dollar rates in rubles into the file currency.txt.

openexchangerates.org only allows you to send requests to its API 1000 times a month. 
Therefore, the program receives currency values every hour.

__By default,  file is stored in the data directory.__

__You may change the `volumes` section in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.__
